# TSJS-Grad-CAM
An implementation of Grad-CAM for tensorflowJS.   
See the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391v1.pdf   
Gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM) is a technique to visualize the decisions of deep learning networks. 

## Acknowledgement
This tensorflow-js implementation is based on the following repositories:
### GradCAM implementation in keras:

## Run Grad-CAM
The 'runGradCAM' file train a model on a pecified dataset and computes the grad-CAM for a given image.
